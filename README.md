GVOA is a RSS reader client for VOA.  But unlike other counter parters which just open the url to show the contnet in the webpage, it parses the html page and save the content locally. 

For learning english, I tried many VOA related applications, but none of them is can meet my requirement. So I decided to write one for myself.  The UI may be very simple, but the features will be very useful. 


Feature List:
1. Parse the html page and save the text and mp3 locally;
1. Support offline mode even when the mobile is not connect to internet;
1. Play/Pause mp3 locally;
1. User can adjust font of the RSS text;



Thanks for the RSS service provided by http://51voa.com
