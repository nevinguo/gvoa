For learning english, I tried many VOA related applications, but none of them is easy to use. So I decided to write one for myself.  The UI will be very simple, but the content will be very useful. 


GVOA is a RSS reader for VOA.  

Feature List:
1) Support off-line reader by local db;
2) Support mp3 player;
3) Support multithread download(in furure);


Thanks for the RSS service provided by http://51voa.com
